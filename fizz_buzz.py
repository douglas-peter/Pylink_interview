# The aim of this section is to write a function that gives to correct solution to the children's counting game
# FizzBuzz up until the user defined upper bound and then print the result. If you are not familiar with this game,
# it works as so. You start counting from one but when you reach a multiple of three you replace the number with the
# word "Fizz" and when you reach a multiple of five, you replace the number with "Buzz", if the number is a multiple of
# three and five (e.g. 15) then it is replace by the combined "FizzBuzz".
